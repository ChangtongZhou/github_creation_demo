Branch:
* git branch <new branch_name> <old branch>
            e.g. git branch new_feature master
* git checkout new_feature : make our new branch the current branch 
* Alternate way of branch:
          git checkout -b new_feature
* See all the branches that exist:
          git branch

Here are steps of creating branch:
* cd your_branch_directory
* git init
* git add .
* git commit -m “your first branching commit”
* git checkout -b “branch_creation_basics”
* git branch
After you did initial branch commit:
When you do some changes, do following steps:
* git branch : make sure you are in the right branch
    * if not in the right branch:
        * git checkout -b “branch_creation_basics”
* git add . or git add your_changed_file
* git commit -am “added updated file”

Straight merge:
* git checkout master
* git merge your_branch_name


Squashed Merge:
Only use it for fixing a bug or adding new features that don’t need each commit tracing your experiments, because you just need the final outcome.
* git checkout master
* git merge —squash master
* git commit -am “a commit message describing the merge”
